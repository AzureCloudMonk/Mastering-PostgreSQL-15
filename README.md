You'll explore advanced PostgreSQL features, such as logical replication, database clusters, advanced indexing, and user management to manage and maintain your database. You'll then work with the PostgreSQL optimizer, configure PostgreSQL for high speed, and move from Oracle to PostgreSQL. Among the other skills that the book will help you build, you’ll cover transactions, handling recursions, working with JSON and JSONB data, and setting up a Patroni cluster. It will show you how to improve performance with query optimization. You'll also focus on managing network security and work with backups and replication while exploring useful PostgreSQL extensions that optimize the performance of large databases.
By the end of this PostgreSQL book, you’ll be able to use your database to its utmost capacity by implementing advanced administrative tasks with ease.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Make use of the indexing features in PostgreSQL and fine-tune the performance of your queries
